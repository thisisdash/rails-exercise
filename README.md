Fork the repository and implement the following behavior:

- scores have a precision of 0.1
- `score_from` has to be lower than `score_to`
- `score_to` has to be higher than `score_from`
- scores cannot overlap with other Ranks

Test the behavior that you added to verify that your implementation is good.

You can find the Web UI on port 3000.

Good luck!
